InSpec profile to validate the secure configuration of Microsoft Windows 10, against [DISA](https://iase.disa.mil/stigs/) Microsoft Windows 10 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) Version 1, Release 20.

## Getting Started
It is intended and recommended that InSpec run this profile from a __"runner"__ host (such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop) against the target remotely over __winrm__.

__For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the _latest version_ of InSpec and supporting Ruby language components.__ 

The latest versions and installation options are available at the [InSpec](http://inspec.io/) site.

## Required Inputs **_prior_** to running the profile

For the best results with your system, we _highly_ suggest that you adjust the values of these profile inputs prior to running the profile.

Many of the inputs have good defaults but some must be set my the end-user.

### Please review and set these `inputs` as best fits your target

The profile _will_ run without updating these values but you will get the _best_ results if you provide the profile with the following data.

- sensitive_system (false) - set to either the string `"true"` or `"false"`
- backup_operators (NULL) - add your usernames as needed
- administrators (NULL) - add your usernames as needed
- hyper_v_admin (NULL) - add your usernames as needed
- av_approved_software(List of AV Software) - add your AV Software Product to this list

## Using your `input` data with the profile

Use the `inputs.example.yml` file as a starting point, and use the `--input-files` flag _or_ set the input via the `CLI` using the `--input` flag.

See <https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/inputs/> for further information.

## Running your profile

To run the profile:

1. Install InSpec on your runner
2. Ensure you have WinRM https access to your traget
3. Ensure you have the 'Admin User' and 'Admin Password' for your system.
4. From your 'InSpec Runner',
   a. if you are using an `input-file`:

   - `inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/microsoft-windows-10-stig-baseline.git -t winrm://<user>@<host> --password <your password> --input-files <your-input-yml> --reporter cli json:<your-results-filename>.json`

   b. if you are using `cli` inputs:

   - `inspec exec https://github.com/mitre/microsoft-windows-10-stig-baseline.git -t winrm://<user>@<host> --password <your password> --reporter cli json:<your-results-filename>.json --input sensitive_system='true' domain_sid='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'`

## Reviewing your Results

### Reviewing Single Runs

The **recommended** review format for for **security review** or **accrediation discussions** or the Security Engineer is the `JSON` results format using the InSpec `JSON` reporter and the MITRE open-souce `heimdall-lite` viewer. You can use heimdall-lite any-time anywhere from: <https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org>.

Heimdall-Lite is a Single Page Client Side JavaScript app that runs completely in your browser and was designed to help make reviewing, sorting and sharing your InSpec results easier.

### Reviewing Large amounts of Runs

If you are scanning large numbers of systems - we recommend you use the [MITRE Heimdall Enterprise Sever](https://heimdall.mitre.org/) which ....
