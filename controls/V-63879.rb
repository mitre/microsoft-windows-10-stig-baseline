  desc  "Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system,
        administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

        The \"Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services\" right defines the
        accounts that are prevented from logging on using Remote Desktop Services.

        If Remote Desktop Services is not used by the organization, the Everyone
        group must be assigned this right to prevent all access.

        In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and
        Domain Admins groups on lower trust systems helps mitigate the risk of
        privilege escalation from credential theft attacks, which could lead to the
        compromise of an entire domain.

        Local accounts on domain-joined systems must also be assigned this right to
        decrease the risk of lateral movement resulting from credential theft attacks.

        The Guests group must be assigned this right to prevent unauthenticated
        access."
