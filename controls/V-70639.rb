  desc  "SMBv1 is a legacy protocol that uses the MD5 algorithm as part of SMB.
        MD5 is known to be vulnerable to a number of attacks such as collision and
        preimage attacks as well as not being FIPS compliant.

        Disabling SMBv1 support may prevent access to file or print sharing
        resources with systems or devices that only support SMBv1. File shares and
        print services hosted on Windows Server 2003 are an example, however Windows
        Server 2003 is no longer a supported operating system. Some older Network
        Attached Storage (NAS) devices may only support SMBv1."
