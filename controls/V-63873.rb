        administrative, and other high level capabilities.

        The \"Deny log on as a batch job\" right defines accounts that are
        prevented from logging on to the system as a batch job, such as Task Scheduler.

        In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and
        Domain Admins groups on lower trust systems helps mitigate the risk of
        privilege escalation from credential theft attacks which could lead to the
        compromise of an entire domain."
