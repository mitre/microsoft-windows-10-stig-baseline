  title "The Deny log on as a service user right on Windows 10 domain-joined
        workstations must be configured to prevent access from highly privileged domain
        accounts."
  desc  "Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system,
        administrative, and other high level capabilities.

        The \"Deny log on as a service\" right defines accounts that are denied log
        on as a service.

        In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and
        Domain Admins groups on lower trust systems helps mitigate the risk of
        privilege escalation from credential theft attacks which could lead to the
        compromise of an entire domain.

        Incorrect configurations could prevent services from starting and result in
        a DoS."
