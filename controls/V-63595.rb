        For those devices that support virtualization based security (VBS) features,
        including Credential Guard or protection of code integrity, this must be
        enabled. If the system meets the hardware and firmware dependencies for
        enabling VBS but it is not enabled, this is a CAT III finding.

        Virtualization based security, including Credential Guard, currently cannot be
        implemented in virtual desktop implementations (VDI) due to specific supporting
        requirements including a TPM, UEFI with Secure Boot, and the capability to run
        the Hyper-V feature within the virtual desktop.

        For VDIs where the virtual desktop instance is deleted or refreshed upon
        logoff, this is NA.

        Run \"PowerShell\" with elevated privileges (run as administrator).

        Enter the following:

        \"Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_DeviceGuard -Namespace
        root\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard\"

        If \"RequiredSecurityProperties\" does not include a value of \"2\" indicating
        \"Secure Boot\" (e.g., \"{1, 2}\"), this is a finding.

        If \"Secure Boot and DMA Protection\" is configured, \"3\" will also be
        displayed in the results (e.g., \"{1, 2, 3}\").

        If \"VirtualizationBasedSecurityStatus\" is not a value of \"2\" indicating
        \"Running\", this is a finding.

        Alternately:

        Run \"System Information\".

        Under \"System Summary\", verify the following:

        If \"Device Guard Virtualization based security\" does not display \"Running\",
        this is finding.

        If \"Device Guard Required Security Properties\" does not display \"Base
        Virtualization Support, Secure Boot\", this is finding.

        If \"Secure Boot and DMA Protection\" is configured, \"DMA Protection\" will
        also be displayed (e.g., \"Base Virtualization Support, Secure Boot, DMA
        Protection\").

        The policy settings referenced in the Fix section will configure the following
        registry values. However due to hardware requirements, the registry values
        alone do not ensure proper function.

        Registry Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
        Registry Path: \\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard\\

        Value Name: EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity
        Value Type: REG_DWORD
        Value: 1

        Value Name: RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures
        Value Type: REG_DWORD
        Value: 1 (Secure Boot only) or 3 (Secure Boot and DMA Protection)
