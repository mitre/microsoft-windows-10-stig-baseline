  title "The Deny log on locally user right on workstations must be configured
        to prevent access from highly privileged domain accounts on domain systems and
        unauthenticated access on all systems."
  desc  "Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system,
        administrative, and other high-level capabilities.

        The \"Deny log on locally\" right defines accounts that are prevented from
        logging on interactively.

        In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and
        Domain Admins groups on lower trust systems helps mitigate the risk of
        privilege escalation from credential theft attacks, which could lead to the
        compromise of an entire domain.

        The Guests group must be assigned this right to prevent unauthenticated
        access."
